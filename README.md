# Module 2 Challenge — Using Data to Determine Rate of Return and Average Trading Volume for Various Stocks and Analyzing the Run-Time of our Refractored Code
______________________________________________________________________
OVERVIEW OF PROJECT 
______________________________________________________________________
  The objective of the module is to apply the VBA programming language to iterate though raw data of 12 stocks and determine the total daily volume that each stock traded at and the average rate of return for each of the stock. This analysis was done for the years of 2017 and 2018. We then analyzed the efficacy refactoring of our code by determining the elapsed run time for our code

RESULTS
______________________________________________________________________
As seen in figure 1 and figure 2, compared to 2018, 2017 was a much better performing year for the rate of return on the stocks we analyzed. There was an average rate of return of 67.3% in 2017. The average rate of return in 2018 was a -8.5%. As seen in figures 1 and 2, the trading volumes for the stocks were about the same for both years

As seen in figure 3 it took an average runtime of 0.127 seconds to run the analysis for 2017. As seen in figure 4, it took an average runtime of 0.137 seconds to run the analysis for 2018.

SUMMARY
______________________________________________________________________

1.  What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The advantages of refactoring code is that our script will run faster, the code is easier to read and therefore easier to amend or debug. The disadvantage is that its time consuming to refractor the code 

2. 	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
 
We saw that our code ran much faster than before refactoring it. The process of refractoring our code was time consuming
